# SuppSys-Production

This is a simple supply managment web application. In addition to supply management it also serves a purpose to track outfiting a federal police unit with individual equimpment.

It is currently being used by a Supply Technician working for a federal government agency.

It is being developed under LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) stack with CodeIgniter (https://codeigniter.com) ver. 3.x.x on the back end while front end is inspired by Responsee (https://www.myresponsee.com/) CSS framework.

The system is in its very early development stage approx. 25% complete with minimal error checking, which means it is not suitable to be used by the public.
